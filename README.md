The idea for this project is a Password Manager which helps to encourage users to use stronger and longer passwords without worrying over possibly forgetting them. 
It is a simple design to make it easily available to a more diverse range of users.
It will allow the users to add and store their account information (websites, usernames and passwords) in a convenient table with the further options of downloading or uploading files from/to the table.
There is also a Password Strength indicator and a Random Password Generator available where one can choose the length of the generated password, ranging from 8 to 25 characters.

It's an easy-to-use Single-Page Application for those who would like a simple and quick place to store their passwords.
